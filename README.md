# NLP_DocumentClassification
A program that makes use of supervised learning classifiers in the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The program takes as input 181 State of the Union addresses (92 by Republican and 89 by Democratic U.S. Presidents), and uses a ***bag-of-words*** approach to extract features and classify each speech as either being made by a Republican or Democratic President.

### Inputs
* ***sotu.txt***: contains the text of 233 State of the Union speeches (including those from Presidents who were neither Republicans or Democrats â€“ these are excluded and not processed).The data was gathered from multiple sources (and thus formats), and some speeches are spread across multiple lines of text.
